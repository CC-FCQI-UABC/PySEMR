# 2.2.2 (2024-01-22)

## Highlights

Mesa 2.2.2 is a small bugfix release, for models in which users had defined  `Model.agents` (`self.agents` in a Model (sub)class). This is deprecated, but for now allowed. See [#1919 (comment)](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/discussions/1919#discussioncomment-8141844).

## What's Changed
### 🐛 Bugs fixed
* Allow user models to assign `Model.agents` for now, but add warning by @quaquel in [#1976](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/1976)

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/compare/v2.2.1...v2.2.2


# 2.2.1 (2024-01-16)

## Highlights
After the huge 2.2.0 release we are releasing 2.2.1 which addresses a few bugs, unintended behaviors and a performance regression. #1960 makes sure agent addition and removal is handled correct, #1965 fixed an unintended behavior change in `RandomActivationByType.agents_by_type` and #1964 makes sure we're at least as fast as before 2.2.0, if not faster. The [introduction tutorial](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/intro_tutorial.html) is also extended with #1955.

We highly recommend updating to 2.2.1 if you're using 2.2.0.

# 2.2.0 (2024-01-09)

## Highlights
The 2.2.0 release of the Mesa library introduces several updates and new features for managing and scheduling agents and modelling the environment, along with an experimental release policy aimed at enhancing development speed and community feedback. Below are key highlights of the new (experimental) features in this release. Mesa 2.2.0 supports Python 3.9+.

Despite the minor version number, this is one of our biggest releases yet.

### Experimental feature policy (discussion #1909)
This release introduces an experimental feature policy aimed at accelerating development and gathering community feedback. Features like #1890, #1898, and #1916 are marked as experimental under this policy.

**Policy overview:**
- Experimental features can be added or changed in any release, even patch releases.
- They don’t need a diligent review for every change, allowing for quicker development cycles.
- Community feedback is encouraged through discussion threads.

### Native support for multiple Agent types (PR #1894)
This update introduces a `agents` variable to the Mesa `Model` class, offering a first step in supporting multiple agent types as first class citizens. Each `Model` is now initialized with an `self.agents` variable (an `AgentSet`) in which all the agents are tracked. You can now always ask which agents are in the model with `model.agents`. It's the foundation which will allow us to solve problems with scheduling, data collection and visualisation of multiple agent types in the future.

### 🧪 AgentSet class (PR #1916)
The new `AgentSet` class encapsulates and manages collections of agents, streamlining the process of selecting, sorting, and applying actions to groups of agents.

**Key features:**
- Flexible and efficient agent management and manipulation.
- Methods like `select`, `shuffle`, `sort`, and `do` for intuitive operations.

**Example:**
```Python
# Applying a method to each agent
model.agents.do('step')

# Filtering and shuffling agents
shuffled_agents = model.agents.select(lambda agent: agent.attribute > threshold).shuffle()
```
_The AgentSet is an experimental feature. We would love feedback on it in #1919._

### 🧪 PropertyLayer and _PropertyGrid (PR #1898)
The introduction of `PropertyLayer` and the extension of `SingleGrid` and `MultiGrid` classes to support cell properties mark a significant enhancement in Mesa's environmental modeling capabilities. It allows to add different layers of variables to grids, that can be used to represent spatial environmental properties, such as elevation, pollution, flood levels or foliage.

**Key features:**
- Efficient management of environmental properties like terrain types and resources.
- Dynamic interaction between agents and their environment.
- Fast modification and selection of cells based on one or multiple properties

**Example:**
```Python
from mesa.space import SingleGrid, PropertyLayer

grid = SingleGrid(10, 10, False)
property_layer = PropertyLayer("elevation", 10, 10, default_value=0)
grid.add_property_layer(property_layer)

# Modify multiple cells values
grid.properties["elevation"].modify_cells(np.multiply, 2)

# Select cells that have an elevation of at least 50
high_elevation_cells = grid.properties["elevation"].select_cells(condition=lambda x: x > 50)
```
_The PropertyLayer is an experimental feature. We would love feedback on it in #1932._

### 🧪 DiscreteEventScheduler (PR #1890)
The `DiscreteEventScheduler` is an innovative addition to the Mesa time module, tailored for discrete event simulations. This scheduler advances simulations based on specific event timings rather than regular intervals, providing more flexibility in modeling complex systems.

**Key Features:**
- Efficient handling of events scheduled for specific simulation times.
- Randomized execution order for events scheduled at the same time.

_The DiscreteEventScheduler is an experimental feature. We would love feedback on it in #1923._

            see an an implementation.

-

    visualization: easier visualization creation #1693

# 1.1.0 (2022-10-10) Safford

**Special notes**

-   Perf: ContinuousSpace: speed-up add/remove agents #1376. This is a
    \~6x performance improvement for add/remove.
-   fix: time: Recompute agent_keys between stages #1391. This is a
    correctness fix for `SimultaneousActivation` and `StagedActivation`
    when agents are being removed during simulation.
-   ModularServer: Always set model.running = True on reset #1399. With
    this change, specifying `self.running = True` in your model
    `__init__` is now optional. Mesa\'s visualization server will
    automatically sets it to `True` in the beginning of a simulation.
-   feat: Allow user-specified local dir to be served by Tornado #1435.
    This simplifies the usage of `ModularServer` in Mesa-Geo.
-   Allow batch_run to take arbitrary parameters #1413. With this
    change, you can finally use any arbitrary Python objects as
    `batch_run` parameters, where previously they are restricted to
    hashable objects only.
-   Prevent seed and random from being shared between instances #1439.
    With this fix, a model instance has their own isolated RNG.
