"""
Mesa Time Module
================

Objects for handling the time component of a model. In particular, this module
contains Schedulers, which handle agent activation. A Scheduler is an object
which controls when agents are called upon to act, and when.

The activation order can have a serious impact on model behavior, so it's
important to specify it explicitly. Example simple activation regimes include
activating all agents in the same order every step, shuffling the activation
order every time, activating each agent *on average* once per step, and more.

Key concepts:
    Step: Many models advance in 'steps'. A step may involve the activation of
    all agents, or a random (or selected) subset of them. Each agent in turn
    may have their own step() method.

    Time: Some models may simulate a continuous 'clock' instead of discrete
    steps. However, by default, the Time is equal to the number of steps the
    model has taken.

    """
    A scheduler for discrete event simulation in Mesa.

    This scheduler manages events where each event is associated with a
    specific time and agent. The scheduler advances time not in fixed
    increments, but to the moment the next event is scheduled to occur.

    This implementation uses a priority queue (heapq) to manage events. Each
    event is a tuple of the form (time, random_value, agent), where:
        - time (float): The scheduled time for the event.
        - random_value (float): A secondary sorting criterion to randomize
          the order of events that are scheduled for the same time.
        - agent (Agent): The agent associated with the event.

    The random value for secondary sorting ensures that when two events are
    scheduled for the same time, their execution order is randomized, thus
    preventing direct comparison issues between different types of agents and
    maintaining the integrity of the simulation's randomness.

    Attributes:
        model (Model): The model instance associated with the scheduler.
        event_queue (list): A priority queue of scheduled events.
        time_step (int or float): The fixed time period by which the model advances
                                  on each step. Defaults to 1.

    Methods:
        schedule_event(time, agent): Schedule an event for a specific time.
        schedule_in(delay, agent): Schedule an event after a specified delay.
        step(): Execute all events within the next time_step period.
        get_next_event_time(): Returns the time of the next scheduled event.

    Usage:
        1. Instantiate the DiscreteEventScheduler with a model instance and a time_step period.
        2. Add agents to the scheduler using schedule.add(). With schedule_now=True (default),
              the first event for the agent will be scheduled immediately.
        3. In the Agent step() method, schedule the next event for the agent
              (using schedule_in or schedule_event).
        3. Add self.schedule.step() to the model's step() method, as usual.

    Now, with each model step, the scheduler will execute all events within the
    next time_step period, and advance time one time_step forward.
